# Alert on exporters not being able to scrape their underlying services.
# Such condition happens when the exporter itself is up (therefore its "up" metric is 1 because
# Prometheus can scrape metrics fine) but it can't contact the service it is exporting metrics for.

# See also Thanos' recording rules for the definition of the exporter:up:avail metric
